# Smart-Dots
Smart Dots is a program that uses a genetic algorithm to solve user drawn mazes.

This project was heavily inspired by this video:

It was made using the processing development enviroment.
See https://processing.org/ for more information.

The genetic algorithm within this program uses a shared fitness function to avoid local maxima. On the settings page of the program you can adjust the distance that fitness is shared and how intensely it is shared (the fitness parameter).

Fast Update Speed refers to the number of updates the program will try to complete within 1 frame.
